## Overview
Simon is a memory and concentration game that challenges players to remember and repeat a series of flashing lights and sounds. The game starts with a simple pattern and progressively adds new steps. The objective is to repeat the sequence correctly. The game ends when the player makes a mistake.

This is a digital version of the classic Simon game, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It features a visual grid of four colored buttons and sound effects that correspond to each color.

## Features
- Simple user interface with a grid of four colors: Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow.
- A pattern sequence that increases in length with each round.
- Sound effects for each color in the sequence.
- A score tracker that increases each time the player correctly repeats the sequence.
- A restart button to start a new game.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simon-game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd simon-game
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to play the game. You don't need any server-side setup; it's a purely client-side application.

## How to Play

1. The game will start by showing a pattern of flashing colors.
2. The player must repeat the pattern by clicking the corresponding colored buttons.
3. With each round, the pattern becomes longer, making it more difficult.
4. The player loses if they click the wrong button at any point.
5. The score will display the current round number (starting at 1 and increasing with each successful round).

### Controls
- Click the colored buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) to repeat the sequence.
- The game automatically starts with a new sequence when you make a correct choice or restart.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for the structure of the game interface.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for the game logic and interactions.

## Acknowledgments

- The game was inspired by the classic Simon memory game.
