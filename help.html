                <li><strong>Watch the Sequence:</strong> The computer will display a series of color flashes in a random order.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat the Sequence:</strong> Click the color buttons in the same order that the computer showed you. You have to click the colors in the same pattern.</li>
                <li><strong>Continue the Game:</strong> If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add one more color to the sequence. The sequence gets longer each time you get it right.</li>
